## Tech Stack

The Tech Stack is a set of technologies we use to build our Ambev products, which is why we can consider it the heart of our products.

All versions of languages, frameworks, and tools have been carefully chosen based on a predefined strategy. We selected the technologies based on our daily challenges and needs.

We use the following technologies in this project:

Backend:

- **.NET 8.0**: A free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications.
  - Git: https://github.com/dotnet/core
- **C#**: A modern object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
  - Git: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang

Testing:

- **xUnit**: A free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework.
  - Git: https://github.com/xunit/xunit

Databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
  - Git: https://github.com/postgres/postgres
